'''
Given an array of numbers sorted in ascending order, return a height-balanced 
binary search tree using every number from the array.
Note: height-balanced meaning that the level of any nodeâ€™s two subtrees should not differ by more than one.

Ex: Given the following nums...

nums = [1, 2, 3] return a reference to the following tree...
       2
      /  \
     1    3

Ex: Given the following nums...

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] return a reference to the following tree...
        3
       / \
      2   5
     /   / \
    1   4   6
